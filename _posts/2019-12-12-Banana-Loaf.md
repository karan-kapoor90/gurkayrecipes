Imagine sitting in the balcony, soaking in the sun with your loved ones, a childhood best friend or your grandkids sipping on something hot or cold. Wouldn't something soft, spongy and a little sweet be the perfect companion to complete the scene? This Banana loaf is super quick to bake and delicious!

## Ingredients

1. 3 Bananas
2. 1 Egg
3. 250gm flour
4. 1 tea spoon baking powder

7. 1/2 cup crushed walnut
8. 3 tea spoon honey
9. 90gm butter
10. 125gm sugar
11. 1/4 tea spoon vanilla essence


## Method

1. Pre-heat oven (Full setting on oven, 180 degrees C on microwave)
2. Mash bananas, lime juice, eggs, sugar, and softened butter
3. Mix with beater or hand (don't beat too hard)
4. Mix walnuts and honey together. Line the cake tin with oil and flour.
5. Put half the banana mix, add walnuts and honey.
6. Top up the tin with the rest of the banana mix and bake for 40 minutes in a moderate oven (180 Degrees Centigrade)
